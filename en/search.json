This post is based on a university project for the course Language Translators. All source code is available in my GitHub repository (link at the end, in the Tools section). The translator takes a source file written in the Boreal Language, previously validated by the processor, and generates an .ens file with the object code of the program, written in the ENS2001 Language. The project is divided into two main parts: Language processor, written in Java, provided by the course and extended by us. Language translator, developed from scratch in Python. Note: This implementation only covers: The sentences IF-THEN and IF-THEN-ELSE. The minimum operator MIN. The procedures PROCEDURE with parameter passing by value and by reference. The operators *, AND and = (comparison, not assignment). ‚ö†Ô∏è The rest of the operators are not covered. ‚ö†Ô∏è No optimization is performed on the generated object code (assembly). Additional Note: All the code in this implementation is written in Spanish, as the course was taught in Spanish. However, this shouldn‚Äôt be a problem, as the concepts are explained in English. 2 Language Processor The language processor is responsible for validating that a source file has no lexical, syntactic or semantic errors. This module is divided into four phases: Lexical analyzer Syntactic analyzer Semantic analyzer Intermediate code generator, which in reality belongs to the translator but is part of the processor‚Äôs code. Before starting, it is important to know the following concepts: Symbol table: is responsible for storing identifiers of variables, constants, procedures, etc. E.g. TABLA PRINCIPAL #1: *LEXEMA: 'S1' // lexeme Atributos: //attributes + Tipo: 'cadena' //type + Despl: 4 //offset + Param: 0 *LEXEMA: 'IMPRIME' Atributos: + Tipo: 'procedimiento' + numParam: 2 + TipoParam0: 'entero' //parameter type + TipoParam1: 'entero' + ModoParam0: 'valor' //parameter mode (value or reference) + ModoParam1: 'valor' + TipoRetorno: '-' //return type + EtiqFuncion: 'EtiqProc2' //procedure label Parse: is responsible for storing the order in which the grammar rules are executed. E.g. bottom-up 2 21 20 19 20 20 18 17 17 17 17 15 9 100 20 100 20 ... bottom-up indicates the type of parser used by the syntactic analyzer. Tokens: can be anything ‚Äî a for, a ;, the name of a variable, etc. The source file is split into tokens, which are stored in a separate file with this name. E.g. \u003cVAR,-\u003e \u003cID,1\u003e \u003cDOSPUNTOS,-\u003e // collon \u003cSTRING,-\u003e \u003cPYC,-\u003e // semicolon \u003cID,2\u003e \u003cDOSPUNTOS,-\u003e ... Finally, the type of parser. In this case, we use a bottom-up parser, but there are also top-down parsers, table-driven top-down parsers, and others. 2.1 Lexical analyzer For lexical errors, we use a finite automaton that goes through the source file character by character. As it advances, it evaluates the states of the automaton, and if everything goes well, a tokens file is generated as output. If any symbol does not fit the automaton, it is considered a lexical error. E.g. of an automaton: A typical case of a lexical error is an unterminated string. The following image shows an automaton that recognizes strings enclosed in quotes: Here, C represents any character. To reach the final state and correctly recognize a string, we need to end with a \". Lexical errors also include situations such as: A string that exceeds the maximum allowed length A number out of range Invalid characters in the language Among others. 2.2 Syntactic analyzer For syntactic errors, we analyze the language structure through grammar rules. These errors appear when the sequence of tokens does not follow the expected syntax. This is where the concepts of first and follow come into play. To explain them, we show a fragment of a grammar: Productions = { Pprima -\u003e P P -\u003e B P P -\u003e F P P -\u003e lambda B -\u003e var T id Bprima ; B -\u003e S B -\u003e if ( E ) W B -\u003e lambda W -\u003e id Sprim","date":"2025-06-17","objectID":"/en/posts/tdl/:0:0","tags":["Java","Python"],"title":"Language Translator","uri":"/en/posts/tdl/"},{"categories":["University","Personal Projects"],"content":"An university project for the course System Oriented Services.","date":"2025-06-17","objectID":"/en/posts/sos/","tags":["Java","Spring","API"],"title":"RESTful Service","uri":"/en/posts/sos/"},{"categories":["University","Personal Projects"],"content":"1 Introduction ","date":"2025-06-17","objectID":"/en/posts/sos/:0:0","tags":["Java","Spring","API"],"title":"RESTful Service","uri":"/en/posts/sos/"},{"categories":null,"content":" Let all you do be done in love ‚Äî 1 Corinthians 16:14 About Me Hey everyone! üëã My name is √Ångel, and I‚Äôm a fourth-year Computer Science student focused on software development and cloud infrastructure management. üë®‚Äçüíª Software developer ‚òÅÔ∏è Passionate about Cloud Computing and Infrastructure ¬†My GitHub: azuar4e In my free time, aside from learning new things, I enjoy working out, reading, and discovering music.
