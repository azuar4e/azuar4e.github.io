The language processor part — responsible for verifying that the source file is error-free — is written in Java by Xiaoyuan Xu, Yuliang Wang, and Caijie Wu, except for everything related to intermediate code generation, which we developed and adapted to Maven. This is an implementation of a language translator built on top of the processor provided by the course. The translator takes a source file written in Boreal Language and generates an output with the intermediate code in the format of a quadruples file. In addition, it produces the processor files (symbol table, parse, errors, and tokens). Then, the object code generator takes the quadruples file and produces a .ens file in ENS2001 language. To install the processor library into the local Maven repository, run: mvn install:install-file -Dfile=\".\\lib\\ts-lib.jar\" -DgroupId=tslib -DartifactId=ts-lib -Dversion=\"1.0\" -Dpackaging=jar To execute the processor: java -jar ./target/tdl-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar ./path/to/borealFile.txt To run the translator, navigate to the gco/ folder and run: python _gco.py ../tdl/src/test/resources/ficheroboreal.txt This will generate the processor outputs, cuartetos.txt (quadruples), and the final object code codobj.ens. To execute the .ens file, you need to download the symbolic assembler, assemble the code, and run it using the ENS2001 virtual machine provided by the course. 1 Tools Both the language processor and the symbolic assembler to compile the ENS2001 object code can be downloaded here: 👉 https://dlsiis.fi.upm.es/traductores/Herramientas.html ","date":"2025-06-17","objectID":"/en/posts/tdl/:0:0","tags":["Java","Python"],"title":"Language Translator","uri":"/en/posts/tdl/"},{"categories":null,"content":" Let all you do be done in love — 1 Corinthians 16:14 About Me Hey everyone! 👋 My name is Ángel, and I’m a fourth-year Computer Science student focused on software development and cloud infrastructure management. 👨‍💻 Software developer ☁️ Passionate about Cloud Computing and Infrastructure  My GitHub: azuar4e In my free time, aside from learning new things, I enjoy working out, reading, and discovering music.
